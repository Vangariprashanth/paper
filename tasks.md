https://norma.ncirl.ie/8615/1/aarthirajendran.pdf - This paper has UCF 101 dataset - which could be useful- https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/research/data-sets/ucf101/
8,000 labeled images,

- https://www.ejournal.isha.or.id/index.php/Mandiri/article/view/406/433 - This paper has CNN code
  current limitations - Angle based - Why the fail - **\*** Simple ML models and DL - Why simple ML models fail ? such as KNN, XGBoost, Randomforest fail - Work on feature engineering - normalization , random noises, removal of keypoints (occlusions) - There dataset is not robust - filming on various devices, outdoors, indoors, lightnings - All the papers consider single frame only - Include spatio-temporal thing - Mobile optimized - Lightweight CNN, Lightweight ViT - TinyML 1. Quantization aware training 2. Post training

justification of why our model works and why not others

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569773 - This paper has limitations of the ML models and why DL is used
" The first limitation in the existing literature on HIC is of
employing machine learning methods, such as Random Forest
and SVM that rely on domain-related features. However, some
studies [10] have been conducted to mitigate this problem
by incorporating the automatic feature extraction capability
of CNN. "
